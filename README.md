**AntiLagPlugin**
Welcome to the AntiLagPlugin, the ultimate bouncer for your Minecraft server! Tired of laggy players slowing down your smooth gameplay? Fear not, for our plugin is here to save the day by kicking those high-ping players out faster than you can say "buffering."

Features
Automatic Lag Detection: Our plugin checks player pings every 5 seconds and boots those with a ping over 200ms.
Smooth Gameplay: Keep your server running smooth and lag-free by ensuring only players with good connections stay.
Magic Reflection: Uses behind-the-scenes magic (a.k.a reflection) to accurately check player pings.
How It Works
When you fire up your server, the AntiLagPlugin springs into action. It runs a task called LagDetectionTask every 5 seconds, acting like your serverâ€™s personal speed cop. If it catches anyone with a ping over 200ms, they get the boot, ensuring your server remains lag-free.

Installation
Download the Plugin: Download the latest release and place the JAR file into your server's plugins folder.
Restart Your Server: Start or restart your server to load the plugin.
Enjoy Lag-Free Gaming: Sit back and relax as the AntiLagPlugin keeps your server smooth and lag-free.
Configuration
No complicated configurations needed! The plugin is ready to go out of the box with a default ping threshold of 200ms. If you wish to customize this, we'll be adding configuration options in future updates.
